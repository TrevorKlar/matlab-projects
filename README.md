# matlab-projects
Some projects centered around solving ordinary differential equations numerically. 

[Project 1](https://github.com/TrevorKlar/matlab-projects/blob/main/project%201%20ver2/Project1_klar.pdf) is fixed-stepsize ODE solver which can use forward and/or backwards methods, and we do a few examples on real-life ODEs. 

[Project 2](https://github.com/TrevorKlar/matlab-projects/blob/main/Project2.pdf) is an ODE solver which dynamically adjusts the stepsize to ensure that stiff ODEs are solved with a predefinable error tolerance. We do a few examples; a predator-prey system, Van der Pol's Equation, and a heat advection problem which is a system of partial differential equations, but by discretizing it using the method of lines we reduce it to an ODE system.
